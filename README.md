# Week 1

Learning Journal

This week, to re-familiarise myself with this subject's contents, I referred to the following materials listed below,
https://www.w3schools.com/html/ - HTML Tutorials readily available on w3schools
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz0aGYrrlhU&t=1807s - HTML tutorial by codewithmosh
I also referred to the work I had done in previous trimesters to get up to speed. 

# Estimated Hours
This week I could only spend, cumulatively, less than 5 hours on CMS. As I am pursuing an internship 
at a digital services company, the project that I was brought in to assist with entered its critical phase. Thus, the majority of my time 
was spent focusing on my internship work.

# Content Insights
Upon reviewing and revisiting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I designed an extremely simple barebones website for a 
simple startup business ideated by myself, just to test my knowledge.

# Career Insights
Upon completing this practical, I realized that an important aspect of web programming is the design aspect of it.
A website's purpose after all is to generate/increase revenue for a company. One such method is using SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)
to increase web visibility in search engines.
