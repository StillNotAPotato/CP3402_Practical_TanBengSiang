I also referred to the work I had done in previous trimesters in order to get up to speed. 

# Estimated Hours
This week I could only spend, cumalatively, less than 5 hours on CMS. As I am pursuing an internship 
at a digital services company, the project which I was brought in to assist with entered its critical phase. Thus, the majority of my time 
was spent focusing on my internship work.

# Content Insights
Upon reviewing and revisiting HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I designed an extremely simple barebones website for a 
simple startup business ideated by myself, just to test my knowledge.

# Career Insights
Upon completing this practical, I realised that an important aspect of web programming is the design aspect of it.
A website's purpose after all is to generate/increase revenue for a company. One such method is using SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)
in order to increase web visibility in search engines.
